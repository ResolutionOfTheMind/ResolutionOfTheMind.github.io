							<td width="100%">"It is not necessary to believe the theory before the practical exercises
								will work for you; just hold it as a possibility, that is all. Even the fact that the
								practical works doesn't make the theory right, for there are a number of possible theories
								from which the practical could be derived. However, until such time as practical derived
								from theory is found not to work it is safe to regard the theory as useful. No more can
								be said of any theory. Also, it's rightness or wrongness depends on how well it explains
								natural law, not what people think about it.<br /><br />I know of no applications where
								this theory falls short of explaining observed phenomena. However, I'll be the first to
								applaud any being who can explain all the facts with a simpler theory from which even
								more workable practical exercises can be derived. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor" target="_blank"><tt><strong>Occam</strong></tt></a> was an old friend of mine.)"
